Werba et al 2022 In review


data_set_up.R cleans data to run models
treatments.R correctly labels treatments for models and graphing
Graphing_Set_Up.R sets up graphing settings
fix_chl.R cleans cholorophyll data

-- the following require cleaned data from above to run ----
daphnia_population.RMD is code to run models and graphs for daphnia final populations and ephippia presence
disturbance_experiment.RMD is code to run models and graphs for chlorophyll and ammonium
pcoa_algae.R runs and graphs PCOA and permanova on algal communities 
sediment_code.RMD runs and graphs sediment models
snail.R runs and graphs size and survival of Physa sp.
